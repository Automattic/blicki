A Knowledge Evolution Revolution: Contribute with ease. Watch how information changes over time.

== Description ==

A Blicki is a blog and a wiki. The purpose is to create a platform on which anyone can share knowledge. The blicki makes it easy to contribute with a front-end blog editor, while showing how information is added to and evolved.

=Features=

* Front-end blog-style editor. No markdown required.

* Anyone can edit. Visitors do not need to create an account to contribute.
* An admin role has the ability to moderate new pages and edits.
* Revision history and stats show at the footer of each blicki entry.
* Links that connect to other entries on your Blicki.
* Each entry has a table of contents. Hello easy navigation.
* Images can be added via hyperlinks. Don’t worry about your Blicki getting weighed down with too much or oversized media.
* The Blicki can be added to previously built sites via a custom post type. You can have a website, a blog, and a blicki all in one!



== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/blicki` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Use the Settings->Plugin Name screen to configure the plugin (?? not sure we’ll have this)
4. Your wiki content can be found by clicking ‘Wiki’ on your dashboard’s sidebar.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What if someone shares false knowledge or something that shouldn't be on the Blicki? =

New entries will be submitted for moderation by an appointed admin. Edits to entries will send a notification to the admin to review.

= Do I have to use the wiki markdown language to contribute? =

Nah - we're adding a front-end blog editor, so you can leave the brackets behind.

= Does the Blicki have a theme song? =

Of course! That blicki. That blicki wiki.

=Why is there a C in Blicki?=

The truth is, bliki.com was registered in 1999 and is unavailable. The good news is, the C symbolizes something entirely new being generated out of two other entities (i.e. the Blog and the Wiki).
